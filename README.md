# Chess

Created the game board and implemented the rules of chess using a 2D array and indexing to define piece locations, possible moves, and all valid (allowed) moves, and used Pygame for the GUI

Implemented NegaMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to increase efficiency and turn depth

The scoring algorithm consists of piece values, positional value, the number of threats, pins, and checks each move creates as well bonuses for special moves such as castling and pawn promotion
